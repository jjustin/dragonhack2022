## Description
Triftify is a web app for exchanging clothes. It's very simillar to the normal thrift shop, with one big difference: there is no real currency. The solution ommits the need for finding a pair of two people who like eachother's unused clothes and uses tokens to promote further exchange on the platform, instead of using even more money to buy new clothes.
